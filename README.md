# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in the group of Stochastic Operations Research ([SOR](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/sor/)) and the Center for Healthcare Operations Improvement and Research ([CHOIR](https://www.utwente.nl/en/choir/)) at the University of Twente, focusing on data-driven mathematical models to improve pandemic preparedness within healthcare systems. My research is part of both the European [RAPIDE EU project](https://www.rapideproject.eu) and a national ZonMw project, where I work on developing practical tools and insights for healthcare applications.

With a background in theoretical mathematics—including analysis, dynamical systems, algebra, number theory, geometry, probability, and statistics—I apply mathematical thinking and modeling to address complex healthcare challenges. My main programming language is Python, and I also have experience with R and MATLAB.

Motivated by the importance of resilient healthcare systems, I enjoy applying mathematical methods to real-world problems that can make a difference. You can learn more about my research and motivations in my [interview](https://www.rapideproject.eu/2025/04/introducing-victor-ploeg-phd-candidate-at-the-university-of-twente/) for the RAPIDE EU project.
